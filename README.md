# Dot-HackUVA
Web application containing interactive map to track red dot/green dot situations around grounds, then analyze the data for future use by various CIO's or authority figures





What I did: Created the idea and worked with 3 others to complete the project, worked full stack to implement the Google Maps API such that a double click on the map would create a marker and comment that the user can enter information into, which is then stored in a Firebase database on the back-end. The color of the marker changes depending on a slider, which switches between red and green. Completed front-end (UI & UX) almost entirely by myself. 

Technologies used: HTML,CSS,Javascript (Vanilla, jQuery, Bootstrap), Firebase, Google Maps API
